## Hi there 👋

My name is Kevin - I'm a PostDoc at Friedrich Schiller University of Jena and the Florida Museum of Natural History of the University of Florida. 
I previously worked and studied at the Georg August University of Göttingen, Technical University of Ilmenau, and Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry.
My research interests cover phylogenomics, morphometrics, integrative taxonomy, and statistical modeling, 🌱 with a particular focus on polyploidy, hybridization, and asexuality in plants.
🔭 Recently, I've been diving into pipeline programming and deep learning approaches. 

I'm always happy to collaborate! 📫 Send me an email at either kevin.karbstein at uni-jena.de or k.karbstein at ufl.edu.
